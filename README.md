## Understanding how to apply SEScore to a translation model

**Natural Language Processing** (NLP) is a field that focuses on creating methods to allow computers to perform tasks involving human language. While this sounds easy as a human, it is challenging for computers and often requires large amounts of data. In particular, this data is made up of input output pairs, where the model is trained to recreate the proper output from the given output. The question then arises – how do we measure the model’s ability to generate the correct output?
